What started as a personal tool became a mini product. I created a smart job tracker that keeps tabs on every application, follow-up, and outcome using Excel and VBA automation. It highlights overdue updates, summarizes progress through a dynamic dashboard, and functions like a lightweight CRM for job hunting. This project shows how I bring automation and structure into real-world problems and reflects the same mindset I would apply to building user-focused tools at SEEK.
