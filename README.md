#### Recruiter Engagement Analytics Pipeline (MySQL)
Automated SQL-based monitoring of recruiter behavior in talent marketplaces
This project simulates a real-world scenario where a talent marketplace platform (like SEEK) needs to track and improve recruiter engagement. Built entirely in MySQL, the pipeline analyzes recruiter login frequency, job posting patterns, candidate interaction rates, and drop-offs.It automatically flags suspicious disengagement, high-performing users, and unusual trends over time, and logs them to a centralized audit table for further BI integration or alert mechanisms.Designed to be modular, schedulable, and scalable, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can directly improve platform health, recruiter satisfaction, and operational efficiency.
